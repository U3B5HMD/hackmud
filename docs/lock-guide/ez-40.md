# EZ_40

## Description

The `EZ_40` lock is the last and most difficult in the line of `EZ` locks. To
crack it, you need to provide one of three possible unlock commands and a prime
number. An unlock command is a string consisting of a single word; a prime
number is a number greater than 1 that is only evenly divisible by itself and 1.

You learn unlock commands by completing the VLAN tutorial.

## How to Crack

To crack an `EZ_40` lock, you need to provide it the correct unlock command and
the correct prime number:

```javascript
abndnd_m2j0yc.access_0fcpi1{EZ_40: "<command>", ez_prime: 5}
```

The three valid unlock commands are: 
  - `unlock`
  - `release`
  - `open`

The prime number is between 2 and 97 (inclusive). Possible prime numbers are: 2,
3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79,
83, 89, and 97.
