# c002

The `c002` is the second in the line of "color" locks that you'll encounter in
Hackmud. To crack it, you'll need to provide a color and its complement. A
color is a string consisting of a single word.

The list of possible colors can be reverse engineered from the colors you see
in the game or by doing quests.

## How to Crack

To crack a `c002` lock, you need to provide the correct color and its
complement.

```javascript
abndnd_m2j0yc.access_0fcpi1{c002: "red", c002_complement: "green"}
```

The possible colors are:

| Index | Color  |
| :---- | :----- |
| 0     | red    |
| 1     | orange |
| 2     | yellow |
| 3     | lime   |
| 4     | green  |
| 5     | cyan   |
| 6     | blue   |
| 7     | purple |

You can calculate the complement of the first color with the following formula:

```javascript
(colorIndex + 4) % 8;
```

For example, if the first color is `red` (index 0) then the complementary color
would be `green` (index 4).
