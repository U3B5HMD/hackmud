# c003

The `c003` is the last in the line of "color" locks that you'll encounter in
Hackmud. To crack it, you'll need to provide a color and its two complementary
colors. A color is a string consisting of a single word.

The list of possible colors can be reverse engineered from the colors you see
in the game or by doing quests.

## How to Crack

To crack a `c003` lock, you need to provide the correct color and its two
complementary colors.

```javascript
abndnd_m2j0yc.access_0fcpi1{c003: "red", c003_triad_1: "cyan", c003_triad_2: "lime"}
```

The possible colors are:

| Index | Color  |
| :---- | :----- |
| 0     | red    |
| 1     | orange |
| 2     | yellow |
| 3     | lime   |
| 4     | green  |
| 5     | cyan   |
| 6     | blue   |
| 7     | purple |

You can calculate the value of `c003_triad_1` with the following forumula:

```javascript
(colorIndex + 5) % 8;
```

For example, if the first color is `red` (index 0) then `c003_triad_1` would be
`cyan` (index 5).

You can calculate the value of `c003_triad_2` with the following forumula:

```javascript
(colorIndex + 3) % 8;
```    

For example, if the first color is `red` (index 0) then `c003_triad_2` would be
`lime` (index 3).
