# EZ_35

## Description

The `EZ_35` lock is the second in the line of `EZ` locks. To crack it, you need
to provide one of three possible unlock commands and a digit. An unlock command
is a string consisting of a single word; a digit is a whole number.

You learn unlock commands by completing the VLAN tutorial.

## How to Crack

To crack an `EZ_35` lock, you need to provide it the correct unlock command and
the correct digit:

```javascript
abndnd_m2j0yc.access_0fcpi1{EZ_35: "<command>", digit: 5}
```

The three valid unlock commands are: 
  - `unlock`
  - `release`
  - `open`

The digit is a random, whole number between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
