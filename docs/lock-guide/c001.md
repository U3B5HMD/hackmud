# c001

The `c001` is the first in the line of "color" locks that you'll encounter in
Hackmud. To crack it, you'll need to provide a color and a color digit. A color
is a string consisting of a single word; a color digit is a whole number.

The list of possible colors can be reverse engineered from the colors you see
in the game or by doing quests.

## How to Crack

To crack a `c001` lock, you need to provide the correct color and a digit equal
to the number of letters in that color:

```javascript
abndnd_m2j0yc.access_0fcpi1{c001: "red", digit: 3}
```

The possible colors are:

| Index | Color  |
| :---- | :----- |
| 0     | red    |
| 1     | orange |
| 2     | yellow |
| 3     | lime   |
| 4     | green  |
| 5     | cyan   |
| 6     | blue   |
| 7     | purple |
