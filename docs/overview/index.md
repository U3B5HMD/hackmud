# Overview

## The Nature of the Game

Hackmud, like the name suggests, is a [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) -
a text based, multi-user game where players explore a virtual world using a
"terminal" provided by the software. Think of it like World of Warcraft but
without any pictures.

Unlike a lot of MMOs, Hackmud doesn't have a single-player story to help drive
or guide the user through the game. Once you leave the tutorial (VLAN), you're
really on your own. For some people, this lack of direction offers a lot of
personal freedom - they get to define what kind of game they want to play and
how to play it. For other folks, the lack of structure makes makes Hackmud feel
like nothing more than a sandbox game for programmers.

When I booted up Hackmud, I felt very much a part of the second group. Outside
of the VLAN, Hackmud felt very much like the early days of Minecraft - sure, it
was fun to punch trees and build a house, but once you've mastered the basics,
it doesn't feel like there's much else to do.

This is why it's important to think of Hackmud not as a game, but as a giant
puzzle box. Hackmud lacks guide posts _by design_. As a player, you're meant to
_try stuff_. Find a lock you've never seen before? Start passing in random
parameters to break it. Discover a random script in a sector? Run it and
see what happens.

A lot of "official" information you'll find on the Hackmud environment is
actually cobbled together notes from various players doing trial-and-error on
something they found. No one _actually_ knows what they're doing.

If solving puzzles without a picture on the box sounds like a good time to you,
then give Hackmud a try. If not, (but you still love the hacker aesthetic) I
recommend you check out

## The Best Way to Play

The purest way to play Hackmud is through random exploration and risk taking,
never asking for help outside the game and never searching for answers online.

The **best** way to play Hackmud is whatever way is the most fun for you as a
player. 

Poke around for hours, never asking for help. 

Jump into the discord and ask veteran players for tips.

Read every spoiler in this guide. Steal every script I've written and use it
to mine every NPC corp you can find.

Do whatever makes you happy and lets you enjoy the game you paid for the most.
Don't let anyone tell you you're playing a game with no structure or goals
"the wrong way".
