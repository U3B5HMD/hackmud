# Prove your Sentience

The best thing you can do for yourself is to work through the (multi-hour long)
tutorial. Yes, it's a lot to take in, but I promise you'll be glad you did once
you make it out of of the VLAN.

If you really don't want to do the tutorial, or you want to initialize a
new user account after completing the tutorial, run: 

```javascript
sys.migrate{}
```

This will immediately migrate your user out of the VLAN and into the main game.

## What to do After the VLAN

Now that you're out of the VLAN and into the MUD, run these scripts to start
exploring: 
  - `teach.me`
  - `teach_si_x80d.each_other`

  After you've feel like you've gotten the hang of the basics, I recommend doing
  a quest.

## Quests

Quests are a type of script. They are puzzles designed to help you learn the
basics of the game, find NPCs, and (potentially) start game events (if any are
running). Plus, they're fun!
  - `aon.memb3rs_only`
  - `pica.nubloops`
  - `skimmerite.learn_to_read`
  - `suborbital_airlines.bulletin`
  - `vacuum_rescue.responder`
  - `packbot.color_calibration`

### Events

The story of Hackmud is progressed through [in-game
events](https://hackmud.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Events). In-game events can
consist of PvP challenges, PvE, or puzzles. In the past, rewards for completing
in game events include access to unique titles, avatars, glams, and even
scripts.

## Asking for Help

Hackmud has a robust and active community supporting it and they don't mind
helping new players. In game, channels like `c00lest_kats` and `town` are good
places for folks to ask questions, but they're also full of spam and bots. Your
best bet for getting questions answered is to join the [Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/NTgT9mnNqF).

If you have questions about this guide or scripting in general (or just want to
chat with other weavers), join `flying_shuttle`:

```javascript
chats.join{channel: "flying_shuttle"}
```
