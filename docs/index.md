# The (Mostly) Comprehensive Hackmud Guide

This guide will walk you through how to play Hackmud. It is meant to be as
comprehensive as possible and provide direct, clear answers to players'
questions about the game and how to play it; even if that means spoiling the
"mystery".

The goal of this guide is to collect all of the various tips, tricks, and
spoilers about the game and aggregate them into a single place That being said,
the information in this guide is limited to what its author(s) know about
Hackmud either through direct experience or via the player community.

### A Word of Caution

As the login prompt at the start of Hackmud states, "larceny, laundering, theft
of currency and information, deception, betrayal, and backstabbing" are all part
of Hackmud. They could very well be part of this guide.

The fun of Hackmud is solving the puzzles. Earning GC, upgrading your system,
and hacking other players is just secondary. If you use this guide to blow
through all the puzzles and find that the game isn't much fun anymore, that's on
you.
